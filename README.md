Lecture recordings on the way!

 Opencast Matterhorn is an opensource lecture recording system used by 
many universities all over the world. Matterhorn can record the video 
of the lecturer and also the computer screen. This app allows you to 
watch both videos side by side or to choose one of them. 
More information all about Matterhorn can be found here:

With this app you can select between the Matterhorn installations 
of registered universities.
